'Spring Boot RESTful API Backend for Employee Management'

Developed a backend application using Spring Boot that provides a set of RESTful APIs for managing employee data. The project focuses on implementing complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with the following features:

- Add Employee – Allows adding new employee records.
- View All Employees – Fetches a list of all employee records.
- View Single Employee (by ID) – Retrieves a specific employee by their unique ID.
- Update Entire Employee Record – Supports full update of employee details.
- Partial Update (PATCH) – Allows updating specific fields of an employee.
- Delete Employee (by ID) – Removes an employee record using their ID.

Key Technologies and Features:
- Spring Boot – For rapid and efficient backend development.
- Spring Data JPA – Used for database interactions with clean repository interfaces.
- ModelMapper – Simplifies mapping between DTOs and entity models.
- Data Validation – Ensures data integrity using annotations (e.g., @NotNull, @Email, etc.).
- Exception Handling – Added custom exception handling for better API responses.

This project highlights a clean and modular backend architecture, focusing purely on backend development with best practices in API design and data management.
